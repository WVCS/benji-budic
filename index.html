   <h2 style="text-align:center; color:#B1740F"> History of the Greatest Pizza on Earth </h2>
   <p style= "font-size:120%;"> According to legend, Sam Panopoulos, a Greek immigrant who moved to Canada in 1954, created the first Hawaiian pizza just over the Michigan border in Chatham, Ontario. “We just put it on, just for the fun of it, see how it was going to taste,” Panopoulos told the BBC earlier this year. “We were young in the business and we were doing a lot of experiments.”

Panopoulos said he and his brothers enjoyed the contrast between the pineapple’s sweetness and the savory flavor of the ham also added to the pizza. They named it Hawaiian pizza after the brand of canned pineapple used on the pie. Adding pineapple on pizza became a heated topic earlier this year after the president of Iceland jokingly denounced the topping, sparking backlash online, a trove of memes and even prompting Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to weigh in. “I have a pineapple. I have a pizza. And I stand behind this delicious Southwestern Ontario creation,” he tweeted in February.

I have a pineapple. I have a pizza. And I stand behind this delicious Southwestern Ontario creation.

   <h2 style="text-align:center;color:#B1740F"> Why It Belongs on Pizza </h2>
     <p style= "font-size:125%;"> First of all, it is scientifically proven that pineapple belongs on pizza. There is nothing better than a little bit of sweetness to cut through a salty snack like pizza. Pineapple adds a much needed pop of sweet to the flavor profile.

 Secondly, pineapple has many health benefits. Pineapple is a tremendous source of Vitamin C, potassium, and fiber. These vitamins and minerals help with blood pressure, digestion, and overall health. You can't hate on topping pizza with something that actually is good for your health. 

Finally, let's face it. We all love chowing down on a piece (or a lot of pieces) of pizza, but we regret that decision a few hours later. Don't forget, though, pineapple is a fruit, just like tomatoes. Therefore, adding pineapples to tomato sauce is almost like having a little "healthy" fruit snack. Next time you can feel a little less guilty about having that extra slice of pizza.
